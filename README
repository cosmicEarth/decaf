Decaf: distributed deep classification framework.

Decaf is a cleaned version of iceberk that results from an overdose of
caffeine-rich drinks. Yangqing is trying to avoid drinking coffee too
much, hence the name.

As of July 2013, resistance is still futile, and the decaf goal is still
unfinished.
